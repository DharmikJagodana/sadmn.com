# Integrating shadcn/ui with Tanstack Table for server-side actions

The inspiration for this project came from the `Tasks` table component of `shadcn/ui`. It is built with `TanStack/react-table`, but it lacks server-side sorting, filtering, and pagination. This project aims to integrate `shadcn/ui` with `TanStack/react-table` to provide a robust table component with server-side actions. The project is bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## A Glimpse into the Technology Stack

This project is built on a robust stack that includes:

- **Next.js** for the framework, providing server-side rendering and static site generation capabilities.
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling, offering a utility-first approach to design.
- **shadcn/ui** for UI components, ensuring a sleek and modern user interface.
- **TanStack/react-table** for the table package, enabling flexible and extensible tables.
- **PlanetScale** for the database, offering scalable MySQL-compatible databases.
- **Drizzle ORM** for object-relational mapping, simplifying database interactions.
- **Zod** for validation, ensuring data integrity through TypeScript-first schema definition.
- **million** for the optimizing compiler, enhancing performance and efficiency.

## Key Features

The integration of shadcn/ui with Tanstack Table boasts several advanced features:

- **Server-Side Operations**: Pagination, sorting, and filtering are handled server-side, reducing the load on the client and improving performance.
- **Customizable Columns**: Users can define columns as per their requirements, ensuring flexibility.
- **Dynamic Inputs**: Search and filters are debounced and faceted, respectively, enhancing the user experience by reducing lag and providing relevant filtering options.
- **Advanced Filtering**: An optional Notion-like filtering feature allows for complex query building.
- **Row Selection Actions**: Selected rows can trigger actions such as deletion, with an optional floating bar for context-specific operations.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sadmann7/shadcn-table
   ```

2. Install dependencies using pnpm

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and update the variables.

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Start the development server

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

5. Push the database schema

   ```bash
   pnpm run db:push
   ```

## Codebase and Deployment

A comprehensive overview of the codebase is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsvjF5Y6-C8&t=1s), and deployment guides for Vercel, Netlify, and Docker can be found in the project's documentation. This ensures that developers can easily share their work and deploy their applications to the web.

## Implementing the Data-table Component

Implementing the data-table component involves cloning the repository, integrating specific folders and files into your project, and configuring environment variables. The documentation provides detailed instructions on setting up database actions, defining table schemas, and configuring table components to interact with your database effectively.

This project is a testament to the power of combining modern web technologies to solve common development challenges. By leveraging shadcn/ui with Tanstack Table, developers can create interactive, efficient, and customizable tables that enhance the user experience and performance of web applications.
